# 🔷 PART 1 — What Top Companies Actually Evaluate

Companies like **Google**, **Amazon**, and **Meta** evaluate:

### ✅ They Test

1. Requirement clarification under ambiguity
2. System decomposition
3. Scalability reasoning
4. Trade-off articulation
5. Data modeling decisions
6. Bottleneck identification
7. Communication clarity

### ❌ They Do NOT Test

---

# 🔷 PART 6 — Advanced (Staff-Level)

* Multi-region architecture
* Active-active vs Active-passive
* Cross-region replication
* Data migration
* Schema evolution
* Consistent hashing internals
* Raft consensus
* SAGA pattern

---

# 🔷 PART 7 — Tracking Template (Your Style)

Since you love structured Excel tracking:

| Question | Pattern | Sub-pattern | Read/Write Type | Scale | Attempt 1 | Bottlenecks Missed | Trade-offs Missed | Final Confidence |
| -------- | ------- | ----------- | --------------- | ----- | --------- | ------------------ | ----------------- | ---------------- |

Color code:

* Green = Strong
* Yellow = Moderate
* Red = Weak

---

# 🔷 Final Advice (Strategic)

You already master:

* Pattern recognition (from DP)
* Structured learning
* Tracking & iteration

Treat HLD exactly the same way:

1. Solve 3 per pattern
2. Identify common architectural motifs
3. Refine trade-offs
4. Revisit after 2 weeks

---

If you'd like next, I can:

* Build a **ready-to-use HLD Excel tracking template structure**
* Run a **real 45-minute mock interview simulation**
* Deep dive one pattern (e.g., Feed system with full architecture)
* Create a **priority-ordered top 30 question list for FAANG**

Tell me your next move.


Excellent. Since you prefer **structured, pattern-wise tracking (like your DP Excel system)**, below is a **ready-to-use HLD Excel template structure** + a **priority-ordered Top 30 FAANG HLD question list**, categorized by pattern and importance.

This is optimized for:

* Structured learning
* Measurable improvement
* Mock interview readiness
* Pattern recognition
