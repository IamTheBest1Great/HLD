# Your 120-Day High-Level Design (HLD) Mastery Roadmap

## From Pattern-Based Thinker to System Design Expert

You already have the right mindset – treating HLD as a set of recurring patterns, tracking progress, and iterating. This 120-day roadmap is designed to turn you into a top-tier system design candidate for FAANG and other product-based companies. It combines foundational knowledge, pattern-based practice, mock interviews, and continuous refinement.

---

## 📌 How to Use This Roadmap

- **Follow the phases sequentially** – each builds on the previous.
- **Track your progress** using the Excel/Notion template provided.
- **Apply the 6-step interview framework** to every practice problem.
- **Color-code your confidence** after each attempt: Green (solid), Yellow (needs work), Red (weak). Revisit reds after 2 weeks.
- **Schedule weekly reviews** – what you learned, what to improve.

## 🧠 The 6-Step Interview Framework (Practice It Every Time)

1. **Requirements (5 min)** – Functional, non-functional, out of scope.
2. **Estimation (5 min)** – Traffic, storage, bandwidth.
3. **API Design (5 min)** – Endpoints, request/response.
4. **High-Level Architecture (10 min)** – Draw components and data flow.
5. **Deep Dive (15 min)** – Zoom into 1-2 critical components (database, cache, queue).
6. **Bottlenecks & Trade-offs (5 min)** – Identify SPOFs, scaling limits, and justify choices.

---

## 🔥 Final Pro Tips

- **Pattern recognition is key** – After solving 3-4 problems in a pattern, you'll see the common skeleton.
- **Trade-off articulation** – Always compare alternatives: "I chose X over Y because of Z trade-off."
- **Mock with peers** – Explaining to others forces clarity.
- **Stay updated** – Read engineering blogs from FAANG (Netflix TechBlog, Uber Engineering, etc.)
- **Rest & confidence** – The last week is for light review and mental readiness.

You now have a battle-tested 120-day roadmap. Stick to it, track relentlessly, and you will crack any HLD interview. Good luck, Shubham! 🚀
